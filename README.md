### Submission Details
This submission contains all files for Parts 1 and 2 of the Final Project. Included in this zip file are:
- Deliverables for Part 1 (found in the “Part 1” folder)
  - A debug apk for the Final Project code
  - A short video showing the app’s functionality
  - A design document (team1006DesignDoc.md), written in Markdown, detailing the functionality of the app and how the team implemented it
  - Cleaned code from part 1
- Deliverables for Part 2 (found in the “Part 2” folder)
  - Performance report (team1006PerformanceReport.md), detailing what metrics we used to measure the app’s performance, how we measured it, and the results we found.
  - Cleaned code with the small changes made for the performance report to measure times for certain tasks to complete
  - A debug apk for the Part 2 code
    - Note: The only difference in the code is the addition of debug statements to display the time it took to perform certain actions, such as inference times.

### Division of work:
- **Hung Hong**: 
  - Coding: Database and Storage management using Firebase, linking the application to the Cloud server, and DataImage Retrieval Process for Database Showcase. Also in charge of data-collection for Performance Profiler
  - Writing: Wrote Design Document sections for the Database section, and the analysis for Performance Profiler Result. Also ensure the layouts of the documents in appropriate format with accompanying images and figures.
  - Design: Designed the overall UI layout along with Hannah Jauris, proposing idea for dividing the main image into 4 equal parts for better inference process.
- **Hannah Jauris**:
  - Coding: UI design and implementation, Inference both on- and off-device, and getting the database code integrated with the different classes and fragments to work properly asynchronously.
  - Writing: Wrote Design Document sections for the UI, Inference, and part of the Databases (retrieving data and how retrieving data interacts with UI), also wrote Performance Metrics, Performance Methodology, Time-Based Metrics Performance, and Summary sections of Performance report, as well as proofreading and editing the rest of the Results section.
  - Design: Designed the overall UI layout, along with Hung Hong
- Note: **Craig Bursey** joined the group, but has not contributed to any of the work required, including the project proposal, coding for the final app, design document for the final app, and the performance profiling and report. He also has not communicated with the group since the project proposal submission, except to inform the group that he had been in the hospital for several days. However, in that message he also said he would have time to contribute to the project, yet has not communicated with either Hung nor Hannah since then. As such, **this submission only counts for Hung Hong and Hannah Jauris.**
